                            Either party may terminate an engagement with written notice as specified in the individual engagement agreement. Termination does not relieve either party of obligations incurred prior to the termination date.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-platinum leading-relaxed mb-8">
                            Upon termination, all confidential information must be returned or destroyed, and all outstanding fees and expenses remain due and payable.

                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-6">14. Force Majeure</h2>
                        <p class="text-platinum leading-relaxed mb-8">
                            Neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform their obligations due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, government actions, labor disputes, or other unforeseeable events.
                        </p>
